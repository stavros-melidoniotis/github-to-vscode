# github-to-vscode
An extension that allows quickly opening github repos with vscode.dev or cloning a repo directly to vscode.

## How to use
Navigate to any github repository and click on the greenish "Code" button on the repo's main page. A new option should be visible with the title "Clone in vscode". Click it and the repo will be cloned directly to vscode!

Another option is to right click on the repository's page and select "Open with vscode.dev". A new tab will open on the vscode.dev page for the specified repository, where you can browse the code like you would with your local projects.
